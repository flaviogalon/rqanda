# Q&A website developed in Rust
Implemented following along the book [Rust Web Development](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-web-development) by Bastian Gruber.

## TODO
Things that I'd like to see but not sure if covered by the book:
- [ ] Handle duplication in POST /questions
- [ ] Auto-generate `id` when creating questions
